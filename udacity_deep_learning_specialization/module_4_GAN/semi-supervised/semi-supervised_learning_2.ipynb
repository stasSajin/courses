    "In supervised learning, we have a training set of inputs $x$ and class labels $y$. We train a model that takes $x$ as input and gives $y$ as output.\n",
    "\n",
    "In semi-supervised learning, our goal is still to train a model that takes $x$ as input and generates $y$ as output. However, not all of our training examples have a label $y$. We need to develop an algorithm that is able to get better at classification by studying both labeled $(x, y)$ pairs and unlabeled $x$ examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this for the SVHN dataset, we'll turn the GAN discriminator into an 11 class discriminator. It will recognize the 10 different classes of real SVHN digits, as well as an 11th class of fake images that come from the generator. The discriminator will get to train on real labeled images, real unlabeled images, and fake images. By drawing on three sources of data instead of just one, it will generalize to the test set much better than a traditional classifier trained on only one source of data."

    "When you run the fully implemented semi-supervised GAN, you should usually find that the test accuracy peaks at 69-71%. It should definitely stay above 68% fairly consistently throughout the last several epochs of training.\n",

    "This is a little bit better than a [NIPS 2014 paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.5298.pdf) that got 64% accuracy on 1000-label SVHN with variational methods. However, we still have lost something by not using all the labels. If you re-run with all the labels included, you should obtain over 80% accuracy using this architecture (and other architectures that take longer to run can do much better)."

In the original work by Tim Salimans at OpenAI, a GAN using [more tricks and more runtime](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03498.pdf) reaches over 94% accuracy using only 1,000 labeled examples."
